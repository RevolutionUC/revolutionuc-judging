[{"Opt-in prize":"Best Use of Twilio","Submission Title":"Denial Dial","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114270-denial-dial","Submission Tagline":"The most clever rejection hotline ever made!","Submission Created At":"3/2/2019 21:33","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\nEver been asked for your phone number by a stranger but you didn't want to give it to them? Denial Dial is here to save the day!\n\nWhat it does\n\nJust text (614) 782-8989 and we will handle the rejection for you. When the stranger texts our number, our server will wait about 30 minutes and send them a text. But we didn't stop there - if multiple people have texted the hotline in the last 30 minutes they will be paired up at random and start texting each other. After a few messages we send them both a carefully worded rejection text and send them on their way!\n\nHow we built it\n\nWe used Twilio's API with Node.js and MongoDB to build a server that responds to texts to the phone number and responds the way we want it to.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nDeployment on Google Cloud Platform was very difficult, especially getting MongoDB to work\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe built something that is useful in the real world and successfully used Twilio APIs which we have never used before!\n\nWhat's next for Denial Dial\n\nWe will keep the server running for the foreseeable future so everyone can use it!","Video":"","Website":"https://github.com/nathan815/denial-dial","File Url":"","Built With":"twilio, node.js, express.js, mongodb","What Is Your Table Number?":"801A-5","Mlh Points":"Eastern Michigan University, University of Michigan","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"","Submitter Screen Name":"markfonte","Submitter First Name":"Mark","Submitter Last Name":"Fonte","Submitter Email":"mark@fonte.com","College/Universities Of Team Members":"University of Michigan - Ann Arbor, Eastern Michigan University","Additional Team Member Count":"1","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"nathan815","Team Member 1 First Name":"Nathan","Team Member 1 Last Name":"Johnson","Team Member 1 Email":"nathancj224@gmail.com","...":"","":"","__1":"","__2":"","__3":"","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Most Innovative Hack(TCS)","Submission Title":"Circuit Builder AR","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114367-circuit-builder-ar","Submission Tagline":"See how to wire a circuit using your phone camera and AR","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 0:05","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\nWhen I was in high school, and even the first few years of college, I found it extremely hard to learn about electronics outside of classes.

The live demo of Twilio's SMS messaging services at the opening ceremony seemed so seamless and so powerful, that we knew we wanted to use their API. 3 hours into the hackathon we came up with Dialext!\n\nWhat it does\n\nDialext is a group texting interface which is meant to take down language barriers and to allow people to communicate with each other by translating all incoming texts to each user's preferred language! \n\nOne of the many reasons Dialext is a great product is its consideration of its users' needs! While many people have unlimited texting these days, unlimited data is still nowhere near as common. There are also many places which have too poor of a signal for good data connections but a good enough signal for SMS. Since Dialext is completely SMS-based (from the user's perspective), it eliminates the need for data, which is required for many other web-based or app-based translation and chatting applications! Another bonus is the convenience - not only does Dialext provide a chatting space for you and your friends, but it automatically does all the translations behind the scenes without the user having to copy/paste the texts from their friends into 3rd party translators!\n\nHow we built it\n\nThe program was built in Visual Studio 2017 using C# .NET. We used Twilio's REST API for sending and receiving SMS messages, Microsoft's Azure Cognitive Services - Translator Text API for translating the individual texts between languages, and ngrok to allow our receiver program to be called by Twilio over the internet. \n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nTwilio Timeout:\n\nTo make this project run, I have two C# .NET applications running simultaneously, but that was not always the case. Initially there was only one C# .NET project, and it was in charge of receiving the incoming SMS messages, decoding the textmessages/phone numbers/ other useful info, checking whether the user was a new or returning user, storing and retrieving user information to/from databases, translating the texts, and sending out the relevant messages to each user based on sender/sendee status, user/admin level, and preferred language. What I didn't know at first was that the Twilio API had a wait time of 15 seconds for a reply before timing out and assuming something was wrong with my server/application and abandoning the SMS request in favor of an error message. \n\nI couldn't find a way to increase the timeout time, so I had to find ways to make a swifter response. Most of the time seemed to come from opening, searching through, and closing the Access databases which stored the currently-active users' phone numbers and preferred languages. I decided to split the project into two. \n\nThe first project would get the SMS message, send the phone number and SMS body (message) into a quick .txt file, and respond with null to Twilio, avoiding the timeout problem. This is the receive program.\n\nThe second project would read each .txt file placed in its reserved directory by the first receive program. This second program would take note of the sender's phone number and message, check for exit codes (if the user is trying to leave the chat) and respond accordingly, report any major changes/errors to the admin, and, of course, translate and send out the messages to each individual user.\n\nAccess Databases\n\nInitially we were using Access Databases (.accdb) to store the information from each user, but we had trouble with the \"Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\" provider which seemed to be on my PC but not recognized by my Visual Studio project - after trying to resolve this problem for about an hour, I prioritized finishing the rest of the project, and simply used .txt files instead.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThis is our first hackathon and we made a functional project!!!! While I've worked with C# before and am familiar with Visual Studio, I've never used Twilio SMS or Azure Translator APIs before, so there was definitely a lot that I learned from this project!\n\nWhat we learned\n\nThe obvious answers are that we learned the Twilio SMS and Azure Translator APIs, but we also learned how to trouble-shoot, make decisions, and adapt quickly to changing conditions/project specifications. Finally, we learned that if we come upon an error/ problem/ question on the software we're building, odds are that somebody before us has thought the exact same thing - Google and StackOverflow are your best friends in these scenarios.\n\nWhat's next for Dialext\n\nA static web page for hosting the Twilio response instructions, for explaining Dialext's purpose, and for letting people sign up their phone numbers online?

This is the receive program.\n\nThe second project would read each .txt file placed in its reserved directory by the first receive program. This second program would take note of the sender's phone number and message, check for exit codes (if the user is trying to leave the chat) and respond accordingly, report any major changes/errors to the admin, and, of course, translate and send out the messages to each individual user.\n\nAccess Databases\n\nInitially we were using Access Databases (.accdb) to store the information from each user, but we had trouble with the \"Microsoft.ACE.OLEDB.12.0\" provider which seemed to be on my PC but not recognized by my Visual Studio project - after trying to resolve this problem for about an hour, I prioritized finishing the rest of the project, and simply used .txt files instead.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThis is our first hackathon and we made a functional project!!!!

We wanted to take the human element out of the forklift operation, but still give them the control and ease of use remotely. Operator related accidents happen on a regular basis and this will keep the operator out of harms way as well as allowing the forklift to be compact enough to transport with ease due to its folding platform. \n\nWhat it does\n\nTo account for this we redesigned the forklift, complete with remote controls to avoid operator injury. The remote control allows the operator to be able to control it from a distance and avoid blind spots that traditional forklifts have a serious problem with.This is not only safe for the operator, but anyone else that may be within its area of use.\n\nIt's design also considered the condition of portability.

We all had an abundance of material and knowledge to be able to construct the forklift without the worry of using unfamiliar materials. With a combination of LEGO Technic and Arduino electronics (motors, Xbox controller adapter, Arduino Shield, and motor controllers) we were able to utilize the functionality of LEGO and the advanced programming options of Arduino.  \n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nThe original plan to implement zero turn was to have free standing wheels on the back and simply drive the front wheels similar to how a shopping cart's wheels work. The weight of the car prevented the wheels from spinning properly so we implemented power steering in the back, trying several designs before arriving at the final design.\n\nThe code we wrote implemented example code taken from Kristian Lauszus and an Xbox controller library developed by felis on GitHub. Learning how this library worked and implementing it properly took some occasional tweaking of the code. \n\nFinally, lining up all the Legos in different planes and their accompanying gears took several attempts for every motor. Matching the necessary torque with the desired speed also took lots of trial and error.\n\nThe attempt to make the forklift arm fold back onto the machine with a motor did not work, as the motors either lacked the proper strength or Legos did not have the desired stability. Because of this we left the arm folding back on the machine as a concept, needed to be done with our hands.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThe power-steering zero turn design was something we did not plan on implementing. We planned on being pressed for time, so developing this over the course of two hours and its accompanying code, left us very satisfied. \n\nGear reductions were also very difficult to build, as they take several planes on mounting that all have to be rigidly locked to the chassis. The payout in torque allows our robot to move as quickly and as powerfully as it does.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWhile each of us came into the Hackathon planning to utilize our different strengths (coding, building, and electronics), we were each able to learn from each other as single-handedly trying to handle any of these tasks was daunting. \n\nWhat's next for our Portable Remote-Controlled Forklift Prototype\n\nBeing a prototype, the potential for actual development is very appealing. While materials like plastic limited our rigidity, real world steel construction would allow our design to be increasingly functional.

These helpful tips are also reinforced through additional resources including Bizkids, Credit Karam and Credit Sesame to further the discussion.\n\nHow I built it\n\nI researched jquery frameworks online and considered how I could integrate key credit information in entertaining ways, and that lead me to use Whack a Mole as a model.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nThe hover reaction that makes the picture change in the animation was challenging.

In addition, we integrated our project with Twillio so that a user could send text requests such as \"What's missing in my fridge?\" to get a list of items to buy when they're at the grocery store.

In addition, we integrated our project with Twillio so that a user could send text requests such as \"What's missing in my fridge?\" to get a list of items to buy when they're at the grocery store.

Movement behaves unpredictably when player's coordinates are outside of the first quadrant. Finding a way to represent the map in a way that is understood by the program was difficult. The camera has a constant fish eye distortion. \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nExtremely lightweight with 235 lines of code.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nBasics of raycasting. Recursive flood fill algorithms (in first iteration). Implementation of key listeners in java. Integrating many classes together (in first iteration). \n\nWhat's next for Java Raycasting Engine\n\nFix fisheye distortion, input issues, and wall rendering issues.

Thus we have had to code and troubleshoot little by little using our best knowledge of how we could get the numbers to convert correctly and how to get the Arduino to receive what we wanted from the python. \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nNot Pulling our hair out during this Hackathon. \n## What we learned\nNot every member of a team has to be great at coding in order to have a successful Hackathon.\n## What's next for Lil’ Drone\nSpeech to Text Recognition to allow Phone Call Speech Commands","Video":"","Website":"","File Url":"","Built With":"raspberry-pi, arduino, betaflight","What Is Your Table Number?":"801c-2","Mlh Points":"UC","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"","Submitter Screen Name":"Jacobhd21","Submitter First Name":"Jake","Submitter Last Name":"Picklesimer","Submitter Email":"picklesimer21@outlook.com","College/Universities Of Team Members":"University of Cincinnati","Additional Team Member Count":"3","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"Nicjtriplett","Team Member 1 First Name":"","Team Member 1 Last Name":"","Team Member 1 Email":"triplenj@mail.uc.edu","...":"marti2rj","":"Robby","__1":"Martini","__2":"marti2rj@mail.uc.edu","__3":"Greeneb2","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"greeneb2@mail.uc.edu","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Best Useless Hack","Submission Title":"MEME","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114798-meme","Submission Tagline":"An fps horror based on putting dead memes where they belong.","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 11:03","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\nConnor had an idea and we decided it sounded fun.\n\nWhat it does\n\nCreated to give a haunting feeling as you waltz through a dystopian cityscape being attacked by suspicious figures.

This is taking up about 500MB or half a gigabyte of data on my computer. Storing the images this way is much better for speed and making less API calls when the script is running. \nBecause this image processing app is running on a few year old laptop, I had to think a lot about efficiency and storing things in sensible ways. This also included cleaning data with Powershell scripts, running tens of command prompts running a python script at the same time with a batch file. \n\nProblems\n\nThe \"official\" python API implementation listed on Spotify's website was very outdated, and the API itself has changed so that this library doesn't work. I ended up finding an open source, and well-kept Python web API for Spotify that worked great. \nSince I'm running an image processing app, it's fairly computing intensive. Being that this is running and crunching a lot of numbers, I have to limit the resolution that I can make the mosaic out of, and it still takes a good amount of time to run.","Video":"","Website":"https://github.com/mattertater/album-art-collage","File Url":"","Built With":"python, opencv, spotify, musicbrainz, powershell, batch","What Is Your Table Number?":"801-14","Mlh Points":"The University of Akron","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"","Submitter Screen Name":"mattertater","Submitter First Name":"Matt","Submitter Last Name":"McDade","Submitter Email":"mmcdade9@gmail.com","College/Universities Of Team Members":"The University of Akron","Additional Team Member Count":"0","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"","Team Member 1 First Name":"","Team Member 1 Last Name":"","Team Member 1 Email":"","...":"","":"","__1":"","__2":"","__3":"","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Best Use of Snapkit (MLH)","Submission Title":"Snap, Paper, Scissors!","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114807-snap-paper-scissors","Submission Tagline":"Need to settle a score with your friends?

help people who are trying to buy products based on the effect that they have on the environment.","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 11:37","Plain Description":"Inspiration:\n\nThroughout high school, I volunteered for a zoo for 4 years and I became passionate about conservation issues. Because of this, I am now a Communication major focusing on Public Relations because I loved talking to people about these issues. My life goal is to work for a company like World Wildlife Fund doing public relations. Having this background of caring for the environment, I like knowing that the products I am buying are as environmentally friendly as possible. That's where I got the idea for this app.\n\nWhat it does:\n\nThis app scans the barcodes of products (currently only food- want to expand it to all other products as well) and tells you if that product does something good for the environment! Currently, it can tell you if the product uses sustainable palm oil, if it's vegan, if it the company has some sort of recycling plan, and if they do not use sustainable palm oil. \n\nHow I built it:\n\nI built this with android studio, java, an API called Nutritionix, and lots of tutorials!\n\nChallenges I ran into:\n\nI ran into lots of challenges trying to understand what different errors meant and how I should fix them. I also had a hard time understanding most of the things I was seeing in the tutorials because I have never done this before! \n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of:\n\nI'm proud because I have never coded anything before in my life. I've never looked at android studio or code before this hackathon! A few days before I downloaded android studio but I didn't have any time to really check it out before! \n\nWhat I learned:\n\nI learned so much! I learned how android studio works and where different things go.  \n\nWhat's next for Stand Up:\n\nI would love to expand the scanning feature to all products so that while someone is walking through the store they can scan anything and know its impacts on the environment! I would also love to add more features like a section where you can find out how to help a specific animal in your daily life, a section to read different blogs, a section to sign petitions, etc. I would love if this app could be a \"one-stop shop\" for people who want to be conscious of their decisions!

Play through the adventures of the wraith and a demon, as they feast upon the bodies and souls of human intruders. Will you succumb to the scourge of crusaders and tourists, or will you reign supreme in the Catacombs of Paris?\n\nWhat it does\n\nThis game features the movement of two separate characters who must work together to defend against intruders. The demon, Terreur, who can feast on the flesh of humans, unless they are armed against unholy beings. The wraith, Peur, can unleash a pulse of wicked energy that will send even the boldest crusaders cowering defenselessly. Once scared, the crusaders are easily devoured, leaving a soul behind for Peur to consume.\n\nHow I built it\n\nThis game was built in Unity3d, albeit in a two-dimensional setting. All character pieces are locked onto a grid, where they are permitted to move one space per action. The characters have their individual collision boxes that let the determined interactions take place. All scores and kill counts are sent to a central processing object, which computes Win/Loss conditions, as well as score and game progress. \n\nChallenges I ran into\n\nCollision avoidance for enemies was tricky, trying to think about it in terms of \"proximity rectangles,\" or bounds that exist relative to an objects location, that check for a target in its parameters. The discrete square-by-square movement was also tricky, this was resolved by giving the physics bodies a directional velocity for a time, after which the object would snap to its supposed final location. The velocity of the object is calculated such that it moves right into its final destination.\n\nAccomplishments that I'm proud of\n\nThis whole game was a solo project, meaning I had to work tirelessly to start and complete the game within the 24 hour time limit. Not only did I have to do all the code and environment construction, all the character designs and spritework, as well as game design fell on my shoulders. It was a lot of work to get an aesthetic and functional object, but it was a thoroughly satisfying experience, as well as a great product to show to colleagues and family.\n\nWhat I learned\n\nProgramming an enemy AI that responds to the player's input and positioning is the biggest learning curve I encountered in my project, since not only did I have to get an appropriate response, the response had to be reformatted to fit the movement rules of the game. \n\nWhat's next for Les Catacombes de Paris\n\nI hope to polish up this game in the future, to smoke out a few bugs, as well as adding a few new features and levels, and maybe even an involved storyline. This game has great potential and can definitely be improved with more time and sanity.\n\nGame Rules\n\nThe Wraith(Tall Skeletal One) is controlled with WASD. the Demon(Short Toothy One) is controlled with arrow keys. Movement occurs when the buttons are pushed. The Demon can  eat tourists (humans in yellow and orange), but will fall if touched by sane Crusader (red and white humans with the hats.)  Defeat all the human invaders to win. The Wraith can unleash a cross shaped blast that can cause humans to be frightened. (They will emit purple spheres when scared.) When crusaders are frightened, they can be eaten by the Demon. Although the Wraith will fall if touched by any humans, killed humans will drop a soul when killed. These souls are worth a lot of points, but will only persist for a bit before losing power and vanishing. If one character falls, they can be revived by the other.

A large amount of people want the convenience of ordering before they go, but don't want to pay extra or wait around for the employees to bring the product to their car.\n\nWhat it does\n\nThis app allows people to order their products online before they head to the store, then they can go to the store and pick them up themselves. Before leaving the employee would only have to check and make sure that the consumer has only the items they ordered. This saves tons of time for the consumer, while also saving the employer money. This in turn allows the consumers to have a lower overall cost.\n\nHow we built it\n\nWe built this app by starting with the backend service. We created an API that runs on an Express server and communicates with data stored in Postgresql. We containerized this application so that it can be run easily on any server. The server communicates through a REST api.\n\nThe website, or the admin page, is built in React and can be accessed through https://storesavr.com (username: dominic password: pa$$word), you will also have to accept the self-signed certificate. This page is made to edit the stores and their respective layouts. The layout editor has 3 different types of items you can click on and add to the editor. A long shelf, short shelf, and an end-cap. These can be dragged out and rotated after they are added. The entire editor can be panned as well.\n\nThe app that we built to demonstrate what the consumer would experience is built in react native. This gave us the flexibility to compile to both iOS and Android, along with having similar code to the admin web portal.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we ran into was running our continuous integration pipeline. We had it set such that if any one member creates a push to the repository, the server would automatically build this application. One of the largest challenges we had was that during the continuous building, we had an issue with one of the libraries we were using. It was our password hashing library and we could not avoid it. It turned out that we needed to install the C++ make files on our docker container to allow it to compile. This took way longer than we expected, but we learned a lot in the process.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThe biggest accomplishment of our application is the draggable editor that we used for the store layout. This took a while for us to perfect, and we are happy with how it came out. It allows users to move their store components into any location and rotation they want, along with choosing which items are in each component.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned how to work together on one single GitHub repository. This was rocky at the start, but we quickly learned to split the work by files or concerns so that none of our changes conflicted with each other's. \n\nWhat's next for Store Savr\n\nA few of the features we want to implement is to add more layout options, along with a fully feature-complete ordering experience. Finding a team member who has a design background would greatly help the app's overall look and feel, as developers can only go so far. We are excited to see the potential this app could bring to the market.","Video":"","Website":"https://storesavr.com","File Url":"","Built With":"kubernetes, docker, node.js, react, react-native, redux, javascript, express.js, domain.com, postgresql, rancher","What Is Your Table Number?":"801M-5","Mlh Points":"Ohio University","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"Domain.com","Submitter Screen Name":"nathanstead","Submitter First Name":"Nathan","Submitter Last Name":"Steadman","Submitter Email":"nathanstead@gmail.com","College/Universities Of Team Members":"Ohio University - Main Campus","Additional Team Member Count":"2","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"BlenderDude","Team Member 1 First Name":"Daniel","Team Member 1 Last Name":"Abdelsamed","Team Member 1 Email":"legonxtphd@gmail.com","...":"DominicBen","":"DominicBen","__1":"","__2":"bdominic00@gmail.com","__3":"","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Best Undergrad Hack (Undergrad Research)","Submission Title":"Store Savr","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114828-store-savr","Submission Tagline":"Easier way to save time and money","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 11:45","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\nWhen looking at current solutions like ClickList and others that allow you to buy groceries online and have them brought to your car, we noticed a hole in the market.

We created an API that runs on an Express server and communicates with data stored in Postgresql. We containerized this application so that it can be run easily on any server. The server communicates through a REST api.\n\nThe website, or the admin page, is built in React and can be accessed through https://storesavr.com (username: dominic password: pa$$word), you will also have to accept the self-signed certificate. This page is made to edit the stores and their respective layouts. The layout editor has 3 different types of items you can click on and add to the editor. A long shelf, short shelf, and an end-cap. These can be dragged out and rotated after they are added. The entire editor can be panned as well.\n\nThe app that we built to demonstrate what the consumer would experience is built in react native. This gave us the flexibility to compile to both iOS and Android, along with having similar code to the admin web portal.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we ran into was running our continuous integration pipeline. We had it set such that if any one member creates a push to the repository, the server would automatically build this application. One of the largest challenges we had was that during the continuous building, we had an issue with one of the libraries we were using. It was our password hashing library and we could not avoid it. It turned out that we needed to install the C++ make files on our docker container to allow it to compile. This took way longer than we expected, but we learned a lot in the process.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThe biggest accomplishment of our application is the draggable editor that we used for the store layout. This took a while for us to perfect, and we are happy with how it came out. It allows users to move their store components into any location and rotation they want, along with choosing which items are in each component.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWe learned how to work together on one single GitHub repository. This was rocky at the start, but we quickly learned to split the work by files or concerns so that none of our changes conflicted with each other's. \n\nWhat's next for Store Savr\n\nA few of the features we want to implement is to add more layout options, along with a fully feature-complete ordering experience. Finding a team member who has a design background would greatly help the app's overall look and feel, as developers can only go so far. We are excited to see the potential this app could bring to the market.","Video":"","Website":"https://storesavr.com","File Url":"","Built With":"kubernetes, docker, node.js, react, react-native, redux, javascript, express.js, domain.com, postgresql, rancher","What Is Your Table Number?":"801M-5","Mlh Points":"Ohio University","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"Domain.com","Submitter Screen Name":"nathanstead","Submitter First Name":"Nathan","Submitter Last Name":"Steadman","Submitter Email":"nathanstead@gmail.com","College/Universities Of Team Members":"Ohio University - Main Campus","Additional Team Member Count":"2","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"BlenderDude","Team Member 1 First Name":"Daniel","Team Member 1 Last Name":"Abdelsamed","Team Member 1 Email":"legonxtphd@gmail.com","...":"DominicBen","":"DominicBen","__1":"","__2":"bdominic00@gmail.com","__3":"","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Make the Customer's Life Easier (84.51)","Submission Title":"Store Savr","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114828-store-savr","Submission Tagline":"Easier way to save time and money","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 11:45","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\nWhen looking at current solutions like ClickList and others that allow you to buy groceries online and have them brought to your car, we noticed a hole in the market.

Traditionally, there is a sort of culture to have script inside code to automate the process of deploying the application onto the web server  using .drone.yml usually which is very ineffective because in this process, businesses have to buy a lot of servers to host their applications. We noticed this problem and brainstormed on this and come up with technologies to work with. For second part of the project 'logging system', we talked to people about server logs in UC. They are paying huge amount of to get logs for their systems so we wanted to find a better solutions, which is free and effective in collecting relative data. \n\nWhat it does\n\nIt improves the automation process by putting applications into docker container by making image of those applications. Then store that image onto google-cloud-platform and use it to tell Kubernetes which application to deploy on one main Kubernetes sites. In this way, web application can be host onto one Kubernetes sever and it will look something like this 'Kubernetes:service1', 'Kubernetes:service2'. Then the next part is our logging system by having setup a APM server to make connection between logging system and web applications. In this way multiple web applications can communicate to logging system and send hosting system and service logs. \n\nHow we built it\n\nWe started with created sample javascript application from where we can track multiple logs and traces. Then we made script inside app.js to connect the application to Kibana logging system. We tested it throughout the process locally. Once we see that logging system is connected to app then we created dashboards and visualizations to get relevant data. Then we started working on deployment process. First we created a script to make image inside Dockerfile then we build image out of it which we then stored it into Google cloud platform. We were making changes to our applications to and making sure that was it updating the image or not. This is where versioning control part plays out.

Traditionally, there is a sort of culture to have script inside code to automate the process of deploying the application onto the web server  using .drone.yml usually which is very ineffective because in this process, businesses have to buy a lot of servers to host their applications. We noticed this problem and brainstormed on this and come up with technologies to work with. For second part of the project 'logging system', we talked to people about server logs in UC. They are paying huge amount of to get logs for their systems so we wanted to find a better solutions, which is free and effective in collecting relative data. \n\nWhat it does\n\nIt improves the automation process by putting applications into docker container by making image of those applications. Then store that image onto google-cloud-platform and use it to tell Kubernetes which application to deploy on one main Kubernetes sites. In this way, web application can be host onto one Kubernetes sever and it will look something like this 'Kubernetes:service1', 'Kubernetes:service2'. Then the next part is our logging system by having setup a APM server to make connection between logging system and web applications. In this way multiple web applications can communicate to logging system and send hosting system and service logs. \n\nHow we built it\n\nWe started with created sample javascript application from where we can track multiple logs and traces. Then we made script inside app.js to connect the application to Kibana logging system. We tested it throughout the process locally. Once we see that logging system is connected to app then we created dashboards and visualizations to get relevant data. Then we started working on deployment process. First we created a script to make image inside Dockerfile then we build image out of it which we then stored it into Google cloud platform. We were making changes to our applications to and making sure that was it updating the image or not. This is where versioning control part plays out. Then we created Kubernetes on command line where we would be hosting our applications. We ran through a lot of steps to set up. Then we created new app for our application along 3 pods and deployed our application onto it. Then we keep making changes to our application and it keeps updating the application.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nIt was so difficult to figure out how to connect Mongodb database to application because we are using login page for the applications. \nFiguring out how to get virtual box on Mac for Kubernetes to work on. \nMinikube was going down so we had to figure out that as well to how to keep it running.\nTo setup everything inside multiple docker container so if one thing goes down, other will be up\nTo configure the logging system to get relevant data which would actually be meaningful to developers and system admin person and also clients\nUse of bootstrap in our application gave us a hard time.\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nWe accomplished the way to host multiple services onto one server using automation docker deployment process\nget the logging which traces \n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\ncreate automated logging system from scratch\nWorking around Docker and google cloud platforms \nLearned how to store docker images into google cloud platform and using it globally for deployment\n\n\nWhat's next for Automation Logging\n\n\nEnterprise companies can implement this automation deployment process and the logging system into their development and staging environment. \nTo help business to monitor their systems and microservices","Video":"","Website":"https://github.uc.edu/sukhbirsekhon/automatedLog.git","File Url":"","Built With":"docker, node.js, kubernetes, elk, css, html5, mongodb, bootstrap, minikube, kubectl, github, visual-studio, google-cloud","What Is Your Table Number?":"801G-3","Mlh Points":"University of Cincinnati","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"Google Cloud Platform","Submitter Screen Name":"sukhbirsekhon","Submitter First Name":"sukhbirsekhon","Submitter Last Name":"","Submitter Email":"sekhonss@mail.uc.edu","College/Universities Of Team Members":"University of Cincinnati","Additional Team Member Count":"2","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"sandhups","Team Member 1 First Name":"Paramjyot","Team Member 1 Last Name":"Sandhu","Team Member 1 Email":"sandhups@mail.uc.edu","...":"calebbotter1","":"Caleb","__1":"Botteri","__2":"calebbotter1@gmail.com","__3":"","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Best Aviation Hack (GE Aviation)","Submission Title":"VR Planetarium","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114856-vr-planetarium","Submission Tagline":"Explore our wonderful solar system in a to-scale VR environment","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 11:55","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\n3 of our 4 group members had never used Oculus Rift or any VR headset before, so we were very interested in exploring virtual reality with the cool hardware provided.

From here, an HTTP request posts the data to the Magic Leap headset, where C# code interprets the data and shows it to you. \n\nChallenges we ran into\n\n\nMagic leap had very limited documentation\nTCP connections weren't allowed so we had to buy our own router to open ports\nSoldering iron had different hardware than what we expected\nTapping into the I2C line on the Soldering iron was difficult\n\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\n\nSuccessfully hacked on to the I2C bus line, directly to the processor\nCreated custom unity components for the first time\nCreated a soldering tutorial and displayed the video in AR\n\n\nWhat we learned\n\n\nFirst time using MagicLeap, so we learned the basics of that\nFirst time having to deal with limited space on a microcontroller (4kb of free space!)\nCovering the entire stack from very low level code to very high level code was a larger task than anticipated\n\n\nWhat's next for soldAR\n\nVideo from the demo will be used on New Territory's social media (@NewTerritoryAR on Twitter!!)","Video":"","Website":"","File Url":"","Built With":"unity, c#, c++, golang, arduino","What Is Your Table Number?":"801-14","Mlh Points":"The University of Akron, The Ohio State University","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"","Submitter Screen Name":"RodneyMorgan97","Submitter First Name":"Rodney","Submitter Last Name":"Morgan","Submitter Email":"rtm36@zips.uakron.edu","College/Universities Of Team Members":"University of Akron, Ohio State University","Additional Team Member Count":"3","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"csinko","Team Member 1 First Name":"Cameron","Team Member 1 Last Name":"Sinko","Team Member 1 Email":"csinko@gmail.com","...":"kjv13","":"Kyle","__1":"Vasulka","__2":"kjv13@zips.uakron.edu","__3":"BrianGlen","__4":"Brian","__5":"Glen","__6":"br.glen@yahoo.com","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Best Design","Submission Title":"shttr","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114871-shttr","Submission Tagline":"You spend 92 days of your life in a bathroom.

Running a simple Apache server could alleviate the issue, but the University's firewall blocked this functionality. The workaround was to set up a Linux virtual machine on Azure, then use SCP to copy the local image onto the virtual machine.\n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nIt works!!!

We have yet to see any applications for browser utilize this feature, so we thought to ourselves why not?\n\nWhat it does\n\nIt acts as an overlay on top of your browser to filter out the pages you don't want other people to access using facial recognition. Imagine some websites that have saved your login credentials, but you don't want your evil friends to see when they borrow your laptop. FaceRek provides a simple yet complete solution such a problem. \n\nHow we built it\n\nThe utilized the powerful AWS Rekognition API to handle facial recognition and the Google Chrome Extension developer kit to build our app.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nMany: setting up AWS to work flawlessly within the Chrome extension; handling the complex flow of authorization; workaround to enable the camera on Chrome extension as it's not natively supported by them. \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nThe extension works perfectly under our tests. It even blocks everything from Maps to Drive when we specify \"google\" as the blocking keyword.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nBuilding with AWS and Chrome extension. Teamwork matters. You can sleep 1 hour a day.\n\nWhat's next for FaceRekExtension\n\nWe will release this extension in near future on Chrome Web Store.

The sound sensor listens for music and produces an analog signal. This analog signal is sampled and processed by the arduino. Then it is converted into a height value corresponding to the intensity of the music and a peak value corresponding to the highest recent spike in intensity. I designed different animations based on these two vales. I then added a push button to toggle between the different modes.\n\nChallenges I ran into\n\n\nThe first controller i used didnt support the led control library i wanted to use so i had to switch to a different board.\nWhen the microphone and led strip were powered off of the same power supply, the extra power consumed by the LED strip would cause interference in the analog signal produced by the microphone\nThe analog signal produced by the microphone is very complicated to understand and I had to try multiple different strategies to find patterns in the data it produced\nThe microphone picks up a lot of noise in the environment other than the music.

For most people that entails forgetting when to take their medicine. We wanted to solve this problem. Also, most drugs today are designed to administer large portions at a time which is ok, but isn't the best for the body. There are little to no methods of slowly releasing medicine that exist today. We were inspired to have multiple dosages per day and that can be difficult to keep track of. We recognized this problem, and we realized that we needed to automate this often difficult and frustrating process. We wanted to solve this problem by creating a wearable that will alert you as soon your time to take your medicine has come. And this will automatically give you medicine in the correct calculated dosage with the added functionality of making it slow release for extra safety.\n\nWhat it does\n\nAutoMed is a 3D printed wearable controlled by a mobile device through a Bluetooth serial connection that access a Google Firebase database that we set up to get correct information to calculate dosage. The application uses software to customize the user experience for every patient and calculates a dosage of medicine based on the patients personal inputs (weight, age) and the type of drug they are taking. The patient logs in to the system by entering their name and phone number. They will then receive a text telling them that they have successfully entered into the system and will receive texts for their dosage periodically. We do this by utilizing Twilio software. Then, when they do get the texts, they can press a button on the wearable and it will automatically inject the necessary amount of drug into their bloodstream. Our application is very secure as it also access Google Firebase for secure authentication.\n\nHow we built it\n\nAutoMed was built mainly by a 3D printer. The device itself was designed in Autodesk Inventor to ensure a compact and secure design optimized for the user experience. 3D printing allowed us to easily make adjustments to the design of AutoMed and guaranteed a low cost product. This makes AutoMed something that is accessible to everyone, including those who do not necessarily have the means to heavily invest in an insulin pen that serves the same purpose as AutoMed. We also developed a mobile app in Android Studio that connects to the wearable using a Bluetooth Serial communication. The app also calculates the correct dosages and the amount of times needing to be administered daily for the corresponding drug and then sends this data over to the device. The calculations and user authentication are done using Google Firebase, and reminders are sent out to the users' phones using Twilio.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we ran in to was the low quality 3D printed parts that were being made with our printer. Our 3D printer that we brought wasn't printing well and was also performing slowly. We intended to conceal most of the electronics with a 3D printed TPU flexible sleeve but our printer was unable to do so. Another big challenge we ran into was deciding on an idea that we all liked. It took us almost 10 hours to think of an idea that we stuck with. We pivoted 3 times before hand.  \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe are proud of the software we were able to create in the short amount of time. Although we weren't able to get the design on par with our vision, we spent a lot of time working on the software to make that exceed our standards. Our app communicates to the device using Bluetooth serial communication. It also connects to Google Firebase and utilizes databases that exist for dosages with respect to characteristics of a human. We also used Google Firebase to authenticate our users that sign into the app. And lastly, after being stunned by the Twilio demonstration during the opening ceremony, we decided to incorporate this in our app. Our app now alerts its users to take their dosage at the correct times of day by sending them a text message by utilizing Twilios software. Our software also calculates dosage and how often the drug needs to be taken by just entering weight, age, and selecting the drug of choice. Overall we are also proud of our 3D printed wearable that we built in only around 12 hours.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWhen working on AutoMed, we learned a lot on both the software and hardware sides. Although we have used Android Studio and java in the past, making a mobile application with Android Studio while integrating bluetooth functionality was new. We ran into many problems and we constantly talked about how next time making a mobile application would be so much easier and how we could make apps on our own. Going to a hackathon is a totally unique experience where you are in a building for 24 hours and are forced to learn new things for that whole 24 hours.. We know as a group that we would not have learned as much as we did about Firebase, Bluetooth serial communication code, and other new software endeavors without coming to this hackathon. Relating to hardware, we learned how to utilize Arduino to control stepper motors which was a very tough task. Along with this, we familiarize ourselves with Arduino Nano and a Bluetooth Module and how we can use the two together as this is our first time working with both of those pieces of hardware.\n\nWhat's next for AutoMed\n\nSome big next steps we are already looking into are incorporating a system where the patient can directly message the doctor through the mobile app and vice versa. This connection will also allow doctors to readily access patient information stored in the database. On top of that, the doctor will be able to regulate the dosage of the medicine remotely. We created this application in Android studio because most of the world uses android to cell phones due to the lack of infrastructure for landline phones. This is why we specially targeted an Android app for this hackathon. In the future we plan on expanding to IOS and swift. This will allow Auto-Med to grow as a medical device to more people outside of our accessible community. Our medicine database as of now only consists of 6 medicines, but we hope to expand to hundreds of medicines which will allow for more universal access to the application and AutoMed.","Video":"","Website":"https://github.com/adarshponaka/AutoMed","File Url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/zip_files/production/41775/zip_files/AutoMed.zip","Built With":"android-studio, arduino, serial-communication, autodesk, 3d-printing, java, medicine, google-firebase, bluetooth","What Is Your Table Number?":"860 d3","Mlh Points":"William Mason High School","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"","Submitter Screen Name":"adarshponaka","Submitter First Name":"Adarsh","Submitter Last Name":"Ponaka","Submitter Email":"adarshponaka@gmail.com","College/Universities Of Team Members":"","Additional Team Member Count":"2","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"AnirudhBali","Team Member 1 First Name":"Anirudh","Team Member 1 Last Name":"Bali","Team Member 1 Email":"balianirudh@gmail.com","...":"shahav2016","":"Aakash","__1":"Shah","__2":"shahav2016@gmail.com","__3":"","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Best High School Hack","Submission Title":"AutoMed","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114981-automed","Submission Tagline":"A 3D printed wearable medical device that safely medicates over the counter drugs","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 13:20","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it can be difficult to remember to remember the small, but important things in life.

The device itself was designed in Autodesk Inventor to ensure a compact and secure design optimized for the user experience. 3D printing allowed us to easily make adjustments to the design of AutoMed and guaranteed a low cost product. This makes AutoMed something that is accessible to everyone, including those who do not necessarily have the means to heavily invest in an insulin pen that serves the same purpose as AutoMed. We also developed a mobile app in Android Studio that connects to the wearable using a Bluetooth Serial communication. The app also calculates the correct dosages and the amount of times needing to be administered daily for the corresponding drug and then sends this data over to the device. The calculations and user authentication are done using Google Firebase, and reminders are sent out to the users' phones using Twilio.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nOne of the biggest challenges we ran in to was the low quality 3D printed parts that were being made with our printer. Our 3D printer that we brought wasn't printing well and was also performing slowly. We intended to conceal most of the electronics with a 3D printed TPU flexible sleeve but our printer was unable to do so. Another big challenge we ran into was deciding on an idea that we all liked. It took us almost 10 hours to think of an idea that we stuck with. We pivoted 3 times before hand.  \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nWe are proud of the software we were able to create in the short amount of time. Although we weren't able to get the design on par with our vision, we spent a lot of time working on the software to make that exceed our standards. Our app communicates to the device using Bluetooth serial communication. It also connects to Google Firebase and utilizes databases that exist for dosages with respect to characteristics of a human. We also used Google Firebase to authenticate our users that sign into the app. And lastly, after being stunned by the Twilio demonstration during the opening ceremony, we decided to incorporate this in our app. Our app now alerts its users to take their dosage at the correct times of day by sending them a text message by utilizing Twilios software. Our software also calculates dosage and how often the drug needs to be taken by just entering weight, age, and selecting the drug of choice. Overall we are also proud of our 3D printed wearable that we built in only around 12 hours.\n\nWhat we learned\n\nWhen working on AutoMed, we learned a lot on both the software and hardware sides. Although we have used Android Studio and java in the past, making a mobile application with Android Studio while integrating bluetooth functionality was new. We ran into many problems and we constantly talked about how next time making a mobile application would be so much easier and how we could make apps on our own. Going to a hackathon is a totally unique experience where you are in a building for 24 hours and are forced to learn new things for that whole 24 hours.. We know as a group that we would not have learned as much as we did about Firebase, Bluetooth serial communication code, and other new software endeavors without coming to this hackathon. Relating to hardware, we learned how to utilize Arduino to control stepper motors which was a very tough task. Along with this, we familiarize ourselves with Arduino Nano and a Bluetooth Module and how we can use the two together as this is our first time working with both of those pieces of hardware.\n\nWhat's next for AutoMed\n\nSome big next steps we are already looking into are incorporating a system where the patient can directly message the doctor through the mobile app and vice versa. This connection will also allow doctors to readily access patient information stored in the database. On top of that, the doctor will be able to regulate the dosage of the medicine remotely. We created this application in Android studio because most of the world uses android to cell phones due to the lack of infrastructure for landline phones. This is why we specially targeted an Android app for this hackathon. In the future we plan on expanding to IOS and swift. This will allow Auto-Med to grow as a medical device to more people outside of our accessible community. Our medicine database as of now only consists of 6 medicines, but we hope to expand to hundreds of medicines which will allow for more universal access to the application and AutoMed.","Video":"","Website":"https://github.com/adarshponaka/AutoMed","File Url":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/challengepost/zip_files/production/41775/zip_files/AutoMed.zip","Built With":"android-studio, arduino, serial-communication, autodesk, 3d-printing, java, medicine, google-firebase, bluetooth","What Is Your Table Number?":"860 d3","Mlh Points":"William Mason High School","Mlh Hardware Lab":"","Mlh Software Lab":"","Submitter Screen Name":"adarshponaka","Submitter First Name":"Adarsh","Submitter Last Name":"Ponaka","Submitter Email":"adarshponaka@gmail.com","College/Universities Of Team Members":"","Additional Team Member Count":"2","Team Member 1 Screen Name":"AnirudhBali","Team Member 1 First Name":"Anirudh","Team Member 1 Last Name":"Bali","Team Member 1 Email":"balianirudh@gmail.com","...":"shahav2016","":"Aakash","__1":"Shah","__2":"shahav2016@gmail.com","__3":"","__4":"","__5":"","__6":"","__7":"","__8":"","__9":"","__10":""},{"Opt-in prize":"Best Use of Twilio","Submission Title":"AutoMed","Submission Url":"https://revuc-viii.devpost.com/submissions/114981-automed","Submission Tagline":"A 3D printed wearable medical device that safely medicates over the counter drugs","Submission Created At":"3/3/2019 13:20","Plain Description":"Inspiration\n\nIn today’s fast-paced world, it can be difficult to remember to remember the small, but important things in life.

In 2007, these two sources comprised of 65 percent of stress, and In 2015 they comprised of 67 percent of stress. We explored the data-set from the National Financial Well-Being survey to learn more about how a wide range of factors relate to consumers' financial well-being. \n\nWhat it does\n\nWe have a short survey for consumers in our application that comprises of 10 most important factors that affect the financial well-being of a person. Depending on the results of the survey, and where they stand relative to the data we gathered, the app offers an exclusive financial plan to the user based on their needs. \n\nHow we built it\n\nWe collected the data-set from Kaggle, and cleaned it by using the Pandas and Numpy libraries in python. We then built our scatter plot using the libraries hosted by the plotly cdn and the Cloudflare cdn. Plotly is the part of D3.JS framework. We used plotly libraries for data visualization. We also used Google's font api \"Google fonts\" to load the railway font. We then stored the clean data in a data variable. After that we parsed through the whole data using the D3 Javascript library. Now we have a form that is using the JSON file to upload the data on a local server and looping through the array to get the average of all the values. Once it has the average, it's publishing the value to the \"y\" value data array we already created in. X values are auto incrementing from 0 to 5001.

In 2007, these two sources comprised of 65 percent of stress, and In 2015 they comprised of 67 percent of stress. We explored the data-set from the National Financial Well-Being survey to learn more about how a wide range of factors relate to consumers' financial well-being. \n\nWhat it does\n\nWe have a short survey for consumers in our application that comprises of 10 most important factors that affect the financial well-being of a person. Depending on the results of the survey, and where they stand relative to the data we gathered, the app offers an exclusive financial plan to the user based on their needs. \n\nHow we built it\n\nWe collected the data-set from Kaggle, and cleaned it by using the Pandas and Numpy libraries in python. We then built our scatter plot using the libraries hosted by the plotly cdn and the Cloudflare cdn. Plotly is the part of D3.JS framework. We used plotly libraries for data visualization. We also used Google's font api \"Google fonts\" to load the railway font. We then stored the clean data in a data variable. After that we parsed through the whole data using the D3 Javascript library. Now we have a form that is using the JSON file to upload the data on a local server and looping through the array to get the average of all the values. Once it has the average, it's publishing the value to the \"y\" value data array we already created in. X values are auto incrementing from 0 to 5001. This whole process gives user a scatter plot in the end that represents the financial wellbeing of the user in comparison to all other people in the dataset.\n\nChallenges we ran into\n\nIt was incredibly difficult to find a suitable dataset in such a short period of time, and that impacted our application greatly. We ran into various challenges. Since back-end development is new to us we had difficulty setting up a Cherrypy server. We were stuck at the configuration process of the server. We also had difficulty \n\nAccomplishments that we're proud of\n\nIn just 24 hours, we built an application using very big data. Our idea solves a serious real world problem.
